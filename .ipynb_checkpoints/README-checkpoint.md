### Background

This dataset is derived from the collection of data from solutions mappers in different regions around the world. As part of a collaborative effort of **[UNDP Accelerator Labs](https://www.undp.org/acceleratorlabs)** and **[Viz for Social Good](https://www.vizforsocialgood.com/)**

Mappers were given the possibility to fill in certain fields in their preferred language, which is why I translated some fields in order to facilitate analysis.

#### The purpose of this analysis is to answer;

Some guiding questions on what we look for:

- Where are the solutions coming from? What is their distribution per country & per region?
- What type of energy source is more prevalent, what is less? Are there differences per region, and why?
- What are global commonalities across solutions; what are typical applications & use cases for solutions? Are there patterns that emerge when looking at the distribution per country & per region? 
- Which Sustainable Development Goals are the solutions advancing in particular, and how?
- Looking at the use case of clean cooking solutions, what is their prevalence, distribution, and source of energy?





### Project Information

> UNDP’s Strategic Plan (2022 – 2025) sets out the ambitious objective **to increase access to clean and affordable energy for 500 million** people by speeding up investment in distributed renewable energy solutions, especially for those hardest to reach and in crisis context. While large grid and financial flows at scale are essential to reach this goal, our Discover and Deploy Solutions Mapping campaign will explore bottom-up, lead user, frugal and grassroots innovations as a contribution to the sustainable energy access moonshot.

### Context
# Header link
>Over the course of 4 months, our network of solutions mappers has discovered 359 grassroots energy solutions from across different regions, demographics and energy sources. The discovered solutions help us to signify the importance of already existing grassroots solutions to energy conservation, augmentation, generation, storage, and distribution in early-stage use. Albeit these are often not yet distributed at scale their existence offers valuable insights and trends on how communities are overcoming their own challenges. **We need to acknowledge the ingenuity and problem solving capacity found in many communities that in turn can feed into UNDP's programming and contribute to achieving UNDP’s ambitious mission moonshot**.

>Visualising the data is essential to help us advocate for the importance of local solutions, their added value and contribution to development at a time when innovation is direly needed given the emergence of contemporaneous crises and inertia in inter-governmental climate negotiations. 



#### Data dictionary

El equipo de UNDP labs proveyó archivo que contenia originalmente dos tablas las cuales contiene la siguiente información. 



- `energy_source` - Identifica el tipo de energia asociada a la solución. Entre las opciones estan 'Hydro', 'Wind' 'Thermal', 'Solar', 'Mechanical', Chemical', 'Household Application', 'Renewable', non-Renewable'.
- `clean_cooking_application` - check que indica que la solución esta asociada con un 'Household Application'. 
- `title` - Breve descripción de la solucion.
- `title_translated` traducción del campo title.
- `mapper` - UNDP Accelerator Lab that has discovered the solution through their mapping process.
- `purposed` - Descripción extendida de la solución.
- `purposed_translated` - traducción del campo purposed.
- `related_link`- En caso de poseer, el equipo que lidera cada solución provee link para conocer detalles.
- `title_translated` - traducción del campo title.
